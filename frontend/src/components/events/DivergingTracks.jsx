/**
 * For each event, a rail spur forking off the main line (x=0) and running
 * up to that event's gate — a single APPROACH leg, mainline joint to the
 * gate's position, angled diagonally.
 *
 * There used to be a second "through" leg continuing past the gate along
 * its own facing direction, on the idea that the track should visibly run
 * through the opening. In practice it just showed up as a stray extra
 * length of rail behind/through each arch leading nowhere (clicking a
 * gate hands off to a separate static page — nothing ever travels that
 * stretch), so it's removed. The spur now simply ends at the gate it
 * leads into.
