/**
 * Fills an archway opening with darkness without ever reading as a flat
 * "card" floating behind it.
 *
 * The old approach (still present in git history) was a single flat plane
 * a couple units behind the opening. Looking straight through the arch
 * that looked fine, but the plane is a finite flat rectangle with real
 * edges — as the minecart travels past the gate at an angle (rather than
 * straight on), those edges and the plane's face at a grazing angle become
 * visible as an obviously flat black rectangle sitting behind the stonework
 * instead of inside it.
 *
 * Fix: build a short open-ended box instead of one plane — a back wall
 * plus two side walls and a roof (no front face, no floor). Whichever
 * angle the opening is seen from while moving, there's still a dark
 * surface roughly aligned with the line of sight (the near side wall
 * catches grazing views that would otherwise skate past a single flat
 * plane's edge), so it reads as "a dark passage" rather than "a black
 * rectangle someone left floating there". All faces are unlit
 * (meshBasicMaterial, toneMapped off) so they stay flat black regardless
 * of the scene's torches/moonlight — that's what makes the entrance itself
 * still read as dark from outside.
