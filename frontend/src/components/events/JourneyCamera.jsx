// horizontal view, which is exactly why the gate (wide relative to tall
// on screen) was cropped out of frame and only became visible by zooming
// the whole page out. Instead we hold the HORIZONTAL fov roughly
// constant and derive the vertical fov (three.js's `fov` prop is always

/**
 * Damped, scroll-driven travel across the whole track. Damping itself is
 * modulated by getSpeedMultiplier(currentZ) — as the camera's *current*
 * position nears any event gate, the per-frame damping shrinks, so the
 * camera visibly slows there and speeds back up once past it. This is
 * distance-based (depends on where the camera actually is), not
 * scroll-velocity-based, so it works the same whether the user scrolls
 * fast or slow.
 *
 * Writes its resolved z/y into `cameraState` (a shared ref from
 * EventWorld) each frame so Minecart can read the exact same authoritative
 * position instead of computing its own — that's what keeps the two in
 * perfect lockstep. Previously the cart snapped straight to a raw scroll
 * value every frame while the camera was damped, which is why the two
 * visibly desynced (cart looked jerky/off-center relative to the smooth
 * camera).
 *
 * `progressRef` is a plain ref (see useJourneyProgress.js), read fresh
 * every frame here — not a React prop — so scrolling never triggers a
 * React re-render of this component or anything above it; only this
 * useFrame callback (already outside React's render cycle) sees the
 * updated value.
