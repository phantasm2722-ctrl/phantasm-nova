/**
 * The scene had no actual sky — just a flat single-color background
 * (`<color attach="background">` in Atmosphere.jsx) plus fog. The
 * reference art's sky has a real gradient: darker at the top, a lighter
 * glowing band low around the horizon/moon. Without that gradient, the
 * cloud sprites had nothing to blend into — their soft edges faded to
 * transparent and exposed the flat colour underneath, which reads as a
 * cloud-shaped patch pasted on top rather than cloud sitting IN a sky.
 *
 * This paints that gradient once onto a canvas (same self-contained
 * technique as the cloud/torch glow textures elsewhere — no external
 * file that can fail to load) and wraps it on the inside of a large,
 * low-poly sphere that rides with the camera, same as the moon/stars in
 * Atmosphere.jsx's skyRef group.
