/**
 * Sketchfab downloads are frequently authored in wildly inconsistent units
 * (a 1-unit-tall gate next to an 11,000-unit-tall minecart is a real
 * example from this project — see chat). Rather than hand-tune a magic
 * scale number per asset that breaks the moment the asset is replaced,
 * measure the model's actual bounding box and fit it to a deliberate
 * target size, recentering its pivot to (0, 0, 0) at ground level.
 *
 * axis:
 *  'y'   - fit by height (architectural pieces: gate, ruins)
 *  'z'   - fit by depth/length (things tiled along the track: railway)
 *  'max' - fit by largest of the three dimensions (irregular props:
 *          minecart, debris, where "height" isn't a meaningful anchor)
