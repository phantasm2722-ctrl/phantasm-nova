/**
 * Returns [{ z, side, facingY }] for every event gate, alternating
 * right/left starting with right, at regular intervals — matches TRACK in
 * config.js. `facingY` is the gate's rotation so its archway opening
 * faces back along the spur that leads into it (derived from the exact
 * same spur geometry DivergingTracks.jsx uses to draw the rail, via
 * TRACK.spurLeadIn/spurOvershoot) — without this the gate keeps its
 * default orientation (matching the entrance, facing +Z) regardless of
 * which direction the spur actually approaches from, which is why the
 * track and the arch opening didn't line up.
 *
 * Anything that needs to know where an event physically sits (data layer,
 * EventGates, camera slowdown) calls this instead of hardcoding numbers.
